🏦🎓 Student Reward & Banking System — Problem Statement

📌 Background

You are developing a console-based Java application for an educational institute.

The institute rewards top-performing students by depositing money into their bank accounts.
After receiving the reward, students are allowed to withdraw money, subject to validation rules.

The system must be robust, fault-tolerant, and use proper exception handling at every layer.
____________________________________________________________________________________________

🧾 Student Details
Each student has the following attributes:
id → unique student identifier
name → student name
marks → marks obtained (0–100)
bankBalance → current bank balance

🎯 Functional Requirements

1️⃣ Student Data Input
Student data is loaded from an external source (file / simulated file method).
The file may not exist or may be unreadable.
The system must not crash due to file-related issues.

2️⃣ Student Validation (Business Rules)

Each student must satisfy the following rules:
name must NOT be null or empty
marks must be between 0 and 100
bankBalance must NOT be negative
If any rule is violated:
The student must be rejected
A meaningful business-level exception must be raised
Processing of other students must continue

3️⃣ Student Ranking & Sorting (IMPORTANT)

Students must be sorted based on:
Marks (descending order)
If marks are equal → Name (ascending order)

After sorting:
Identify the top 3 students
Only these students are eligible for rewards

4️⃣ Reward Deposit Operation

Deposit ₹5000 into the bank account of each top 3 student
Deposit operation must:
Validate deposit amount
Prevent invalid updates
Handle unexpected runtime issues safely

5️⃣ Withdrawal Operation

After reward deposit, each student may attempt to withdraw money.

Withdrawal rules:
Withdrawal amount must be greater than 0
Withdrawal amount must NOT exceed available balance

If balance is insufficient:
Withdrawal must fail
A custom banking exception must be raised
Program must continue for other students

⚠️ Exception Handling Requirements (MANDATORY)

Your design must demonstrate the use of ALL exception handling techniques:

🔹 Checked Exceptions
File reading failures
External resource access issues
Must be declared and/or handled properly

🔹 Unchecked Exceptions
Null values
Invalid index access
Logical programming mistakes
Must be handled where recovery is possible

🔹 Custom Exceptions (Business Meaning)
You must define custom exceptions for:
Invalid student data
Invalid deposit operation
Insufficient bank balance during withdrawal

These exceptions must:
Carry meaningful messages
Represent business logic violations, not technical errors

🔹 throw
Must be used to explicitly signal:
Invalid student
Invalid banking operation
Business rule violation

🔹 throws
Must be used to:
Delegate exception responsibility between methods
Clearly define which layer is responsible for handling failures

🔹 try–catch–finally
Used to:
Protect risky operations
Recover gracefully from failures
Ensure cleanup or final logging is always executed

🧠 Design Expectations (NO CODE, ONLY THINKING)
Your solution should clearly separate:
Data loading logic
Validation logic
Sorting & ranking logic
Banking operations
Exception handling responsibility

Each method must clearly indicate:
What exception it may throw
Whether it handles or delegates responsibility

🚫 What NOT to Do
Do NOT crash the program for one bad student
Do NOT use throws for unchecked exceptions unnecessarily
Do NOT catch Throwable or Error
Do NOT mix business validation with file handling logic

🎯 Final Goal

By implementing this problem, you should be able to:
✔ Apply real-world sorting logic
✔ Understand where to throw vs where to catch
✔ Design clean exception delegation
✔ Handle both checked & unchecked exceptions correctly
✔ Think like a production-level Java developer

🔥 Practice Challenge (Mental Only)

Before coding, ask yourself:
Which methods should throw exceptions?
Which layer should catch them?
Which exceptions should be checked vs unchecked?
Where should sorting happen — before or after validation?
Should deposit & withdrawal share the same exception type?
