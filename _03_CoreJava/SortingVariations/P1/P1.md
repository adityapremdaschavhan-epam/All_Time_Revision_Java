# 📌 Problem Statement — Student Sorting

You are given a list of **StudentScore** objects.  
Each `StudentScore` contains the following fields:

- **id** *(integer)* — unique student identifier
- **name** *(string)* — student name
- **score** *(integer)* — marks obtained by the student

---

## 🎯 Objective

Write a program to **sort the students** based on the following rules:

### 🔹 Primary sorting key
- Sort students by **score in descending order** (higher score first)

### 🔹 Secondary sorting key (tie-breaker)
- If two or more students have the **same score**, sort them by **name in ascending alphabetical order**

### 🔹 Final output
- Return a list containing **only the student names** in the sorted order

---

## 📥 Input

A list of `StudentScore` objects, for example:

```java
[
  (1, "Alice", 88),
  (2, "Bob", 90),
  (3, "Charlie", 88)
]
```

# 📤 Output

A list of student names sorted according to the rules:

["Bob", "Alice", "Charlie"]
🛠 Constraints

1 ≤ number of students ≤ N

Student names are non-null

Scores are non-negative integers

Sorting must be stable and deterministic

## 💡 Expected Approaches

The problem can be solved using any of the following approaches:

Java Streams API

Comparator with lambda expressions

Comparator.comparing() with method chaining

Implementing Comparable in the StudentScore class

## 🧠 Key Concepts Tested (Interview Perspective)

Object sorting in Java

Comparable vs Comparator

Multi-level sorting (primary + secondary keys)

Streams vs Collections API

Clean design and readability
