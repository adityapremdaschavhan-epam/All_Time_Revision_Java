PROBLEM 3 — FACTORY (FOR TESTING / AUTOMATION)
📌 Problem Statement (VERY IMPORTANT)

Design a Browser Driver Factory for test automation.

Scenario
Your automation framework must support:

Chrome
Firefox
Edge

Requirements
Factory should return appropriate WebDriver
Browser type should be configurable
Client test classes must not create drivers directly
Driver creation logic must be centralized

Easy to extend for new browsers
👉 You will implement this later (critical for automation interviews).
