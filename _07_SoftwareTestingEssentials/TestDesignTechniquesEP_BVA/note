EP + BVA — Quick Scenario-Based Revision Script
1️⃣ What are EP and BVA? (1-Line Each)

Equivalence Partitioning (EP): Divide inputs into groups where the system behaves the same; test one value per group.

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): Test edge values (min, max, just inside and outside boundaries) where defects commonly occur.

2️⃣ When to Use EP & BVA

Use EP to reduce test cases.

Use BVA to catch edge-case defects.

Best practice: Apply EP first, then BVA.

3️⃣ Scenario (System Under Test)

Requirement:

Age field accepts values from 18 to 60 (inclusive).

4️⃣ EP — Scenario-Based Explanation
Identify Partitions
Partition Type	Input Range	System Behavior
Valid	18–60	Accepted
Invalid	<18	Rejected
Invalid	>60	Rejected
Invalid	Non-numeric / empty	Error
EP Test Cases (One per partition)
Test Value	Expected Result
30	Accepted
15	Rejected
70	Rejected
"abc"	Error

📌 EP ensures functional coverage with minimum tests.

5️⃣ BVA — Scenario-Based Explanation
Identify Boundaries

Minimum = 18

Maximum = 60

BVA Test Cases
Value	Why	Expected
17	Just below min	Rejected
18	Min boundary	Accepted
19	Just above min	Accepted
59	Just below max	Accepted
60	Max boundary	Accepted
61	Just above max	Rejected

📌 BVA focuses on high-risk edge conditions.

6️⃣ EP vs BVA (Quick Comparison)
EP	BVA
Covers input groups	Covers edge values
Reduces test cases	Finds boundary defects
Misses edge cases	Misses mid-range behavior
7️⃣ EP + BVA Together (Why Interviewers Like This)

EP → broad input coverage

BVA → critical edge coverage

Together → efficient + reliable testing

8️⃣ Coverage Evaluation Using EP/BVA

✔ All valid inputs tested
✔ All invalid inputs tested
✔ All boundaries covered

👉 Test coverage is sufficient

9️⃣ One-Line Interview Answer (Power)

I use Equivalence Partitioning to reduce test cases by grouping similar inputs and Boundary Value Analysis to test edge values, ensuring maximum coverage with minimal effort.

🧠 Ultra-Short Memory Trick

EP = Groups
BVA = Edges
