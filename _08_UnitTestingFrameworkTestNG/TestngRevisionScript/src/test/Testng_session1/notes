try to disrupt the app find loop hole
not to find the defect do not create loophole(usecase)

1) testng advantages :-
ci/cd

2) a) .properties for env variables
    eg :- db details config
        production config

    b) how to passed env variables  (taken by jvm)
    ans :-
    maven profiles (multiple testng.xml) no need to change testng's
    mvn test -d profile

3) sure fire plugins :- to identify @test at mvn test life cycle

4) never launch a browser before test launch "before every methods"

5) assertions :- reduce boiler code
    assertNotNull,

6) depends overwrite priority

7) a)difference between contestant (runs before every @test) launch browser
    and @beforetest (before <test>)

    b)listener runs in background in jvm
    annotations runs by testng framework

8) data
    store in separate files
        yaml more preferred
        json preferred not best for understanding
        excel is volatile cannot be trusted
        which is best to use

9)reporters:-
    extend enhance than testng give us html file
    allures more enhance tha  extend picturisation and graph
    testng
    report portal :-  epam opensource portal
                      own instance report portal.io
                      all report for past execution and we can create dashboard
                      synchronous execution is going in background
                      auto analysis of test cases like (git ai) -
                      uses ml concepts for automation framework like testng,junit


10) bug life cycle
 headline
 description
 expected and actual;l
 envirnment
 snapshot
 priority severity
    egample :- high priorty and low sveerity -> company logo.

    jira boards

        bug life cycle
        new
        assigned
        in progress
        done
        retest
        closed

        after all the bug is fixed -> then we can do regresion test
        for each bug fixed ->

11) schema validation :- validating,datatype key.
    to make sure integration should work -> we do contract testing (schema validation)
    scenario :- microservices

12) test pyramid. api -> integration -> ui

13)


to do's:-
how to passed env variables  (taken by jvm)
ans :-
maven profiles (multiple testng.xml) no need to change testng's
mvn test -d profile

--------------home task------------

2) create 9 test
    3 test sequence
    3 test parallel
    3 test group parallel

3) home task_______________________________
a) create a maven
with multiple properties

b) create properties in resources -> qa,prod,test
url=
password

c) use this properties
mvn test -qa -> go and test execute
    stage prod without changing the code

d) testng .xml ->
pom.xml-> all the dependence

e) difference between extend and allures and report.
try all these in project

f) modify these cases with selenium

g) modify these with bdd
