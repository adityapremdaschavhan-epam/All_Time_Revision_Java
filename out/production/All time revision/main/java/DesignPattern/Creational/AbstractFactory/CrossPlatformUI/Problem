Problem Statement

You are building a Cross-Platform UI Toolkit.
Your application should support multiple operating systems:
Windows
macOS

Each operating system provides its own UI components:
Button
Checkbox

Requirement
UI components must be platform-specific
Components from the same platform must be used together
Client code should not depend on concrete classes
Switching platform should be easy (Windows → macOS)

What this problem tests
Understanding of family of related objects
Why Factory alone is not enough
How Abstract Factory enforces consistency

Hint
Think in terms of:
Button interface
Checkbox interface
UIFactory abstract factory
WindowsUIFactory, MacUIFactory
