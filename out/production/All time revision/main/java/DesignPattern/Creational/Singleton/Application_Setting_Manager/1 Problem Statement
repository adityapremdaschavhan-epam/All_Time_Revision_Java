You are building a Simple Application Settings Manager.

The application has multiple modules:
Login module
Dashboard module
Reports module

Each module needs access to application settings such as:
applicationName
environment (DEV / QA / PROD)

AppSettings.class
 └── instance ──▶ Object@100

LoginModule      ──▶ reference to Object@100
DashboardModule  ──▶ reference to Object@100
ReportsModule    ──▶ reference to Object@100

Requirements
Settings should be loaded only once
All modules should see the same settings
No module should be allowed to create a new Settings object
Settings object should be globally accessible

🎯 What this problem is testing
This problem checks whether you understand:
Why only one object is needed
How multiple callers share the same instance
Difference between object creation and object usage
This is pure Singleton thinking.

🧠 THINK BEFORE CODING (IMPORTANT)

Ask yourself:
Should every module load settings again? ❌
Should settings be mutable? ❌
Where should settings live? ✅ One place

➡ Singleton fits perfectly
